# Zardoy Keybindings

> I actually didn't find the better name.

<!-- TODO store description in one place -->

Sometimes mac and win have different keys, but in most of cases CTRL = CMD.

## Important Defaults

- Never Close Windows on `CTRL+W`
- `CTRL+N`: Create file **always** in explorer. It means, that you need to **first name it** and only then you can write code.
- `CTRL+SHIFT+D`: Duplicate line, because default shortcuts with arrows are bad.
- `CTRL+K S`: Start main NPM script (`start`, `dev`, `watch` etc). (for save all use `alt+ctrl+s`)
- CTRL+U and CTRL+J reassigned to match better terminal workflow (`CTRL+J` for toggling visibility only, focus always on editor)

## What's New

These are less important.

- `alt+cmd+S or ctrl+alt+s`: Save all files. Because we don't have built-in key.
- `ctrl+k ctrl+b`: Toggle sidebar. `ctrl+b` won't work in `.MD` files with Markdown extension.
- (mac) `alt+escape` Show parameter hints (to trigger autocomplete: `CMD+I`)

## Keybindings to Remove

- tab: acceptSelectedSuggestion
- tab: insertSnippet
- ctrl+': editor.togglequotes
- ctrl+shift+t: surround.with

- Ctrl+/ new typescript import â€“ I reassigned it also because I often misclick that button, because of one-level enter. I don't really use this shortcut right now.

## Extension Shortcuts

- transpose: v4run.transpose
- GitHub Manager
- Extra Commands
- NPM THE FASTEST
- Change Case menus: hjdarnel.vscode-change-case
- <kbd>CMD+1</kbd>: Surround

## TODO

npm start script
npm scripts
npm deps view (install?)
