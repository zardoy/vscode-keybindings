## Important Defaults

I hope you find them useful.

- Never Close Windows on `CTRL+W`
- `CTRL+N`: Create file **always** in explorer. It means, that you need to **first name it** and only then you can write code.
- `CTRL+SHIFT+D`: Duplicate line, because default shortcuts with arrows are bad.

## What's New

These are less important.

- `ctrl+k s`: Run `start` or `dev` script.
- `alt+cmd+S or ctrl+alt+s`: Save all files. Because we don't have built-in key.
- `ctrl+k ctrl+b`: Toggle sidebar. `ctrl+b` won't work in `.MD` files with Markdown extension.

## Free keys

They will be remapped.

### Win only

- ctrl+Y
